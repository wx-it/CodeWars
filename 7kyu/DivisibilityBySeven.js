/*
A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is divisible by 7.
In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. 
Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this
 number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is 
 divisible by 7 or not.
